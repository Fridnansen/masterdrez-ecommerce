# TODO: Implement Add Product Form with Validations and MockAPI Integration

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Create new component `src/components/AddProduct/AddProduct.jsx` with controlled form, validations, and MockAPI POST functionality.
- [x] Add protected route `/add-product` in `src/App.jsx` for the AddProduct component.
- [x] Add "Agregar Producto" link in `src/components/Nav/Nav.jsx` for authenticated users.
- [x] Modify `src/components/ItemList/ItemList.jsx` to fetch products from MockAPI instead of hardcoded data.

## Followup Steps:
- [x] Test the form submission and validations.
- [x] Verify products are added to MockAPI and displayed in the list.
- [x] Ensure the app runs without errors.
